<h4>Kijovo’s use of cookies and similar technologies</h4>
       <p>Kijovo uses cookies and other similar technologies, such as pixels or local storage, to help provide you with a better, faster, and safer experience. Here are some of the ways that the kijovo services—including our various websites, SMS, APIs, email notifications, applications, buttons, widgets, and ads—use these technologies: to log you into kijovo, save your preferences, personalize the content you see, protect against spam and abuse, and show you more relevant ads.
Below we explain how kijovo, our partners, and other third parties use these technologies, your privacy settings and the other options you have.
 </p>

    <h3>What are cookies, pixels, and local storage?
</h3>

<p>Cookies are small files that websites place on your computer as you browse the web. Like many websites, kijovo uses cookies to discover how people are using our services and to make them work better.</p>
<p> pixel is a small amount of code on a web page or in an email notification. As many services do, we use pixels to learn whether you’ve interacted with certain web or email content. This helps us measure and improve our services and personalize your experience on kijovo.</p>
<p>Local storage is an industry-standard technology that allows a website or application to store information locally on your computer or mobile device. We use local storage to customize what we show you based on your past interactions with kijovo.</p>

    <h3>Why does kijovo use these technologies?</h3> 
<p>Kijovo uses these technologies to deliver, measure, and improve our services in various ways. These uses generally fall into one of the following categories:
</p>
        <h5>Authentication and security:</h5>
<ul class="security">
 <li>To log you into kijovo</li>
    <li>To protect your security</li>
    <li>To help us detect and fight spam, abuse, and other activities that violate the <a href="rules">kijovo rules</a> </li>
    <li>For example, these technologies help authenticate your access to kijovo and prevent unauthorized parties from accessing your account. They also let us show you appropriate content through our services.
</li>
</ul>
       <h5>Preferences:</h5> 
<ul class="security">
    <li>To remember information about your browser and your preferences</li>
    <li>For example, cookies help us remember your preferred language or country that you are in. We can then provide you with kijovo content in your preferred language without having to ask you each time you visit kijovo. We can also customize content based on your country, such as showing you what topics are trending near you, or to withhold certain content based on applicable local laws.  
</li>
</ul>
        <h6>Analytics and research:</h6>
        <ul class="security">
            <li>To help us improve and understand how people use our services, including kijovo buttons and widgets, and kijovo Ads
</li>
            <li>For example, cookies help us test different versions of our services to see which particular features or content users prefer. We might also optimize and improve your experience on kijovo by using cookies to see how you interact with our services, such as when and how often you use them and what links you click on. We may use Google Analytics to assist us with this.
</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Personalized content:</h5>
        <ul class="security">
            <li>To customize our services with more relevant content, like tailored releases, contests, ads, and suggestions for things to clock
</li>
<li>For example, local storage tells us which parts of your kijovo you have viewed already so that we can show you the appropriate new content. Cookies can help us make smarter and more relevant suggestions about what you might enjoy clocking based on your recent visits to websites that have integrated kijovo buttons or widgets. We can suggest business who are frequently followed by other kijovo users that visit the same websites. 
</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Where are these technologies used?</h3>
        <p>Kijovo uses these technologies on our own websites and services and on other websites that have integrated our services. This includes our platform partners’ websites and sites that use kijovo buttons or widgets, like our clock or like buttons. Third parties may also use these technologies when you interact with their content from within our services, like when you click a link or stream video on kijovo from a third-party website.
</p>
        <h3>What are my privacy options?</h3>
        <p>We are committed to offering you meaningful privacy choices.  You have a number of options to control or limit how kijovo, our partners, and other third parties use cookies:
For tailoring suggestions on kijovo: If you do not want kijovo to tailor suggestions for you based on your recent visits to websites that have integrated kijovo buttons or widgets, you can turn off this feature using your kijovo account settings. This removes from your browser the unique cookie that enables the feature. 
For using cookies: You can modify your settings in most web browsers to accept or deny all cookies, or to request your permission each time a site attempts to set a cookie. Although cookies are not required for some parts of our services, kijovo may not work properly if you disable cookies entirely. For example, you cannot log into kijovo.com if you've disabled all cookie use.
